So for the mobile I used a max-width of 600 pixels as it is supposed to be smaller compared on a mobile device.
For laptops I used a minimum width of 601px (going beyond the 600px threshold of mobile devices) and had a max width of 992 pixels.
For tablets, I did a variation of sizes between 993 pixels 1200 pixels. 

Linear/Angular Gradients:
For the linear-gradients and the angular linear-gradients, I used the linear-gradient on the main homepage to change the overall background of the wrapper div element, and for the contacts I also used an angular-linear-gradient with a degree of 45.


Colour Scheme:
For my colour scheme, I used the following hexadecimal colours;
#4A8EE8
#6B4AE8
#4A5DE8
#4AC0E8
#9E4AE8
#A3ABEB

While not all of these colours were used, the general scheme was meant to produce a friendly subtle vibe to my website. It was primarily used in the wrapper element to encapsulate the friendly vibe of the website overall!

For the below references, I primarily used the code from the slides and tweaked it as necessary, thus I used Professor Sheikh for my citation.
