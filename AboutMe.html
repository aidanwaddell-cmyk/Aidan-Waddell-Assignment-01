            <p>So, as stated on my home page, my name is Aidan Waddell, and I am a current second-year Networking & IT Student here at Ontario Tech University! I'm currently attending as a mature student, and prior to attending the University I spent five years in the workforce primarily working as a private security professional along with five years of experience as a primary reservist with the Canadian Armed Forces! Currently, I serve at the Chief Operations officer for the Networking & IT Student Association, also known as Netsoc for short. It's with this student association that I've made a handful of peers and have gained a tremendous amount of practical experience with actual Cybersecurity and IT related topics, and hope to continue to grow with them for the rest of my time here at Ontario Tech University!</p>
